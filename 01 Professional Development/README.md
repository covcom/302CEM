By this stage you will have had an opportunity to observe your group dynamics.

1. Assess the contribution made by each member of the team using the information from the presentation.
2. Using the Group Roles listed in the presentation identify which categories each member of your team belong to. Do you have a balanced team?

## The Elevator Pitch
You should now have a clear idea about what you will be developing. Your final task for this week is to put together an Elevator Pitch using the guidelines in the presentation. You will be asked to stand up and deliver your pitch to the rest of the group. You should take notes on the other group projects.

1. Are there any other teams working on a similar idea? You should chat to them and see if you can divide the work between the teams.
2. Are there any other teams proposing a project that might enhance your offering? Chat to them and see if you can make use of this other work.

## Share Ideas
To get a good grade in this module you need to collaborate with other teams. The steps below will help you start this process.

1. Complete the Group Details Form on Moodle, describing both your team and your idea.
2. Identify any teams on Moodle that you might collaborate with and explain how this could take place.
3. Add these team members to your LinkedIn network.

## Getting Support
During this module you will be expected to work in a team to develop a sophisticated app using the language and platform of your choice, however this is not a technical module and you will not be taught the technical programming skills you need to apply.
If you are worried about your technical competence then it is recommended that you build a dynamic website. This can be achieved using the Python Flask framework. 

1. You will have been taught Python during your previous modules and the Flask framework is simple enough to pick up after a couple of hours. There are plenty of online tutorials that teach this topic.
2. The module covers a number of technical topics but there will always be sample code that can be applied to this language and framework.
3. Take advantage of the programming support sessions which run daily in the EC building. All staff running this can help you with Python code.
